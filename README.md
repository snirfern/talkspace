Talkspace Senior Fullstack Developer Assignment
Part 1
I asked chatGPT the following things:
• Build for me a simple booking system with features for creating both standard and anonymous
bookings.
• Users can specify details like time, patient, provider, and booking status.
• The application records booking status changes over time, providing a comprehensive status
history.
• Additionally, it associates bookings with unused credits and allows users to retrieve their
booking history or the timeline of status changes for a specific booking.
• The database should be managed through Sequelize, offering a relational mapping to a MySQL
database.
• Please also allow to show the provider some statistic about bookings getting canceled by the
client and being rescheduled, and the patient statistic about how many credits he used per
month.
The result is here.
Add code review.
